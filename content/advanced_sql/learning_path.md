Our learning adventure consists of two ways. The first one can be grouped into abstract categories, namely

#### SQL functions

* ###### Basics (WIP)
* ###### [Scalar functions]({{< ref "advanced_sql/functions.md#scalar-functions" >}})
* ###### [Aggregate functions]({{< ref "advanced_sql/functions.md#aggregate-functions" >}} "Aggregate Functions")
* ###### [Window functions]({{< ref "advanced_sql/functions.md#window-functions" >}} "Window Functions")
* ###### [Table functions]({{< ref "advanced_sql/functions.md#table-functions" >}} "Table Functions")

It is meant to used like an Encyclopedia if you know what you are looking for. The other approach is to be guided by examples which slowly start to increase in complexity and will help to solve problems we encounter in our day to day work.

#### Use cases

1. Running Totals (WIP)
2. Simulating a for-loop  (WIP)
3. Comparing different time periods  (WIP)
4. Distinct counts  (WIP)
5. Basket analysis  (WIP)
6. Currency conversion  (WIP)
7. Hierarchies  (WIP)
8. Events in progress  (WIP)
9. Ranking  (WIP)
